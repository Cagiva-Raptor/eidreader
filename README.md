eidreader (Java applet)
=======================

International eID card reader.

This is an applet to read the publicly available information (name,
birth date, national id,...)  on electronic ID cards of different
countries and make them accessible to the Javascript code of a web
page.

This project is no longer maintained!  The successor projet is
implemented in Python here:
https://github.com/lino-framework/eidreader

The Python implementation works using a different approach without
using any copy of some official Belgian eID Java library.  We are
looking for somebody who would rewrite the Python code to Java.
